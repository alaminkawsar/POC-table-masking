# Weekly Plan
## 15 Jan 2026 - 18 Jan 2026 (Tuesday - Sunday)
- [x] Task 1: Annotation more than 15 images using label studio
  - Candidate elements:
    - Table Column
    - text_field with label
    - text_info with label
- [x] Task 2: Finetune YOLO model for UI element detection
  - Finetune YOLOv8n model but performance was not satisfactory
  - Finetune YOLOv8l model and performance was better.
  - 
- [x] Task 3: Inference on test images and evaluate model performance
  - Class-wise Performance Summary:
  | Class         | Images | Instances | Precision | Recall | mAP50 | mAP50-95 |
  |---------------|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|----------|
  | table_column  | 1      | 3         | 0.999     | 1.000  | 0.995 | 0.813    |
  | text_field    | 1      | 14        | 0.978     | 0.857  | 0.929 | 0.589    |
  | text_info     | 1      | 6         | 0.800     | 0.833  | 0.883 | 0.468    |
