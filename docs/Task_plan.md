## Problem understanding and requirements analysis
### 🧩 Problem Statement
Given a UI image containing multiple UI elements, the system should:
1. Detect UI components
2. Extract text from them
3. Identify sensitive content based on user rules
4. Mask those values in the image


**For example:** Masing table header: **Rev Nbr**, Table column values: **Line Number**, Textfield value with label: **Order Customer**, **Sold To**, **Ship To**.
- **Input Image** <br> <img src="input.jpeg" alt="Input Image Example" width="400"/>
- **Output Image** <br> <img src="output.jpg" alt="Output Image Example" width="400"/>
<br><br>
